# Getting started

## Before You Begin

Before you can use most of the API's service, you will need to complete the following steps:

1. An Account On the IQM platform
2. Run at least one campaign
3. A Client ID and Client Secret

If you do not have any of the above,  please follow the steps below.

* [Sign up for an IQM Account](https://app.iqm.com/#/signup)
  * Use your work email as a username and create a secure password
    * Password must be at least 8 characters in length
    * Requires at least 1 uppercase letter
    * Requires at least 1 lowercase letter
    * Requires at least 1 special character
* To Run a Campaign:
  * See the [Create a New Campaign Guide](https://help.iqm.com/en/articles/5651476-create-a-new-campaign)
* Email [integrations@iqm.com](mailto:integrations@iqm.com) to request a Client ID and Client Secret.

An hour after running a campaign, you can generate reports on it.
