# IQM Platform

## Overview

IQM is a powerful DSP platform that employs many of the familiar principles of advertising technology. This page will cover the common entities, hierarchies, and relationships used by IQM.

## Advertising Hierarchy

<center><img className='diagram' src={AdChart} /></center>

As seen in the above diagram, an **Advertiser** (also known as a user or customer on the IQM platform) creates **Insertion Orders** which have child hierarchies of **Campaigns**. Campaigns then have an additional child hierarchy of **Creatives**.

## Advertising Relationships 

The IQM platform contains various APIs (applications on the UI) which interact with, modify, and carry the details of, each advertising entity. This section will cover some of those relationships.
