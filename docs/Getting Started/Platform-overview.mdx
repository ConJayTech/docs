# IQM Platform Overview

## Overview

IQM is a powerful DSP platform that employs many of the familiar principles of advertising technology. This page will cover the common entities, hierarchies, and relationships used by IQM. 

## Advertising Hierarchy

In IQM's organizational framework, **Insertion Orders** are the parent hierarchy of advertising. They are created by Advertisers (read more in the [Organization Hierarchy](#organization-hierarchy) section) with **Campaigns** as their child hierarchy. Campaigns then comprise **Creatives**. 

The following diagram and accompanying definitions further describe the relationships between these entities.

<center><img className='diagram' src={AdChart} /></center>

<center><div class="smallTable">
| Entity Description | |
| --- | --- |
| **Advertiser** | A user or customer on the IQM platform that places advertisements with a media partner. |
|  |  |
| **Insertion Order (IO)** | A contract between an advertiser and media partner that specifies the details and parameters of an advertising campaign. Read more about IOs in our [Help Center<ExternalLink />](https://help.iqm.com/en/articles/8365220-what-is-an-insertion-order) articles.  |
| | | 
| **Campaign** | A targeted advertising run that operates for a set period of time under specified optimization strategies. Read more about Campaigns in our [Help Center<ExternalLink />](https://help.iqm.com/en/collections/1962110-create-a-campaign) articles.  |
| | |
| **Creative** | The file containing the actual advertisement that a user is exposed to. This is commonly in graphical, video, or audio format.

## Advertising Relationships 

The IQM platform contains various APIs (applications on the UI) which interact with, modify, and carry the details of, each advertising entity. This section will cover some of those relationships. 

### Insertion Orders

Insertion Orders are managed in the [**Campaign API**](/Guidelines/Campaign-API-Guidelines). Users can create and modify IOs, duplicate existing IOs, adjust an IO's budget, and delete IOs. 

Insertion Orders specify important parameters for their Campaigns. They dictate the length of time for an advertising Campaign and the budget parameters. They can also return details for campaigns grouped by IO IDs. 

The [**Bid Model API**](/Guidelines/Bid-Model-API-Guidelines) also contains important functions for IOs. Users can fine-tune their advertising targeting strategy by assigning priority metrics to groups of Campaigns by their IO ID.

</center>

### Campaigns 

Campaigns are primarily managed in the [**Campaign API**](/Guidelines/Campaign-API-Guidelines), but also interact with several other APIs. Users can create Campaigns, get details, and assign Conversions with the Campaign API. 

Campaigns specify important parameters for their associated Creatives. They dictate the audience targeting, Inventory placement, optimization strategies, assigning Conversions, and Reporting data. 

The [**Bid Model API**](/Guidelines/Bid-Model-API-Guidelines) allows users to add Bid Modeling strategies to their Campaigns. It can also generate a metrics Report by chosen dimensions to evaluate a Campaign's performance. 

The [**Conversions API**](/Guidelines/Conversion-API-Guidelines) allows users to assign created Conversions to a Campaign. This can also be managed in the Campaign API. 

The [**Insights API**](/Guidelines/Insights-API-Guidelines) allows users to generate a Voter Level Data Report. A VLD Report allows users to evaluate ad exposure, demographic data, and voting history details. 

The [**Inventory API**](/Guidelines/Inventory-API-Guide) allows users to select inventories for ad placement for a Campaign. 

The [**Reports API**](/Guidelines/Reports-API-Guidelines) allows users to generate, manage, and send Reports on their Campaigns.

## Organization Hierarchy

**Workspace** access allows users to manage multiple accounts within their agency on the IQM platform. Workspaces are used to manage the permissions and credentials of their assigned **Organizations/Advertisers** (known as **Customers** in this relationship) so they can access Reporting and audiences. 

Workspaces also manage financial operations such as margins, costs, invoices, and credits. 

Workspace Users can access real-time data and Reporting across their Customers in one place. 

**Organizations/Advertisers**, once assigned to a **Workspace User**, place advertisements with the DSP service. A Workspace User may have access to multiple Organizations/Advertisers, but may only have access to certain apps as determined by the Workspace.

Insertion Orders and Campaigns are created at the Advertiser level. Organizations/Advertisers manage their own balances.

The following diagram and accompanying definitions further describe the relationships between these entities.

<center><img className='diagram' src={WorkspaceChart} /></center>

<center><div class="smallTable">
| Entity Description | |
| --- | --- |
| **Workspace** | A company that provides DSP service. Defines permissions and credentials for Customers. |
| | |
| **Workspace User** | An individual who uses the platform in a Workspace. Has advertisers assigned as customers. |
|||
| **Organization/Advertiser** | An organization is any company that places advertisements and is assigned to a Workspace User. <br />When invited as a Customer, an organization is created with details including its name, website, and location details. |
</div></center>

## Organization Relationships

Organizations, Workspaces, and Users are primarily managed in the [**User Management API**](/Guidelines/User-Profile-Guidelines) and the related [**Workspace API**](/Guidelines/Workspace-Guidelines). The [**Finance API**](/Guidelines/Finance-Guidelines) also manages the various financial relationships that exist between Workspaces and Advertisers. 

Users and Customers can be invited to sign up with the platform with the User Management API.
