# IQM Platform

## Overview

IQM is a powerful DSP platform that employs many of the familiar principles of advertising technology. This page will cover the common entities, hierarchies, and relationships used by IQM.

## Advertising Hierarchy

<center><img className='diagram' src={AdChart} /></center>

As seen in the above diagram, an **Advertiser** (also known as a user or customer on the IQM platform) creates **Insertion Orders** which have child hierarchies of **Campaigns**. Campaigns then have an additional child hierarchy of **Creatives**.

| Entity Description | |
| --- | --- |
| **Advertiser** | A user or customer on the IQM platform that places advertisements with a media partner. |
|  |  |
| **Insertion Order (IO)** | A contract between an advertiser and media partner that specifies the details and parameters of an advertising campaign.

| **Campaign** | A targeted advertising run that operates for a set period of time under specified optimization strategies.

| **Creative** | The file containing the actual advertisement that a user is exposed to. This is commonly in graphical, video, or audio format.

## Advertising Relationships 

The IQM platform contains various APIs (applications on the UI) which interact with, modify, and carry the details of, each advertising entity. This section will cover some of those relationships. 

### Insertion Orders

Insertion Orders are managed in the **Campaign API**. Users can create and modify IOs, duplicate existing IOs, adjust an IO's budget, and delete IOs. 

Insertion Orders specify important parameters for their Campaigns. They dictate the length of time for an advertising Campaign and the budget parameters. They can also return details for campaigns grouped by IO IDs. 

The **Bid Model API** also contains important functions for IOs. Users can fine-tune their advertising targeting strategy by assigning priority metrics to groups of Campaigns by their IO ID.
