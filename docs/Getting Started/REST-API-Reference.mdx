# REST API Overview

The IQM platform uses standard REST API calls and responses for its applications. 

Review the following sections for the basic information on API specifications to avoid errors and workflow interruptions. 

### Prerequisites 

The minimum requirements are: creating an account with IQM, running at least one campaign, and attaining authentication to use the platform. Review the [Before You Begin](/Getting%20Started/Before-You-Begin) page for details on these requirements before using the IQM API. 

Alternatively, see the [Authentication Quickstart Guide](/Quickstart%20Guides/Authentication-Quickstart-Guide) to sign up, log in, and obtain an authentication token. Then, see the Quickstart Guide for [Creating a New Campaign](/Quickstart%20Guides/Upload-Creative-and-Create-a-Campaign-API-Quickstart-Guide). 

Once these steps are completed see the other [Quickstart Guides](/Quickstart%20Guides/) and the [Guidelines](/Guidelines/) pages for a comprehensive overview of the IQM platform's API. 

### Authentication

API access token expires 24 hours after generation. [Generate a Refresh Token](/Quickstart%20Guides/Authentication-Quickstart-Guide#refresh-token) for uninterrupted access to data.

### HTTP Request Methods

Data resources are accessed via standard HTTP requests in UTF-8 format to an API endpoint. Please refer to [MDN Documentation<ExternalLink />](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Web/HTTP/Methods) on methods for more information. 

 The IQM API uses the following HTTP methods:
