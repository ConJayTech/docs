# REST API Overview

The IQM platform uses standard [REST API<ExternalLink />](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/REST) calls and responses for its applications. Our API has URLs organized by resource, supports form-encoded requests, returns JSON-encoded responses, and uses standard HTTP response codes. 

```json title="Base URL"
https://app.iqm.com
```

Review the following sections for the basic information on API specifications to avoid errors and workflow interruptions. 

## Prerequisites 

The minimum requirements are: creating an account with IQM, running at least one campaign, and attaining authentication to use the platform. Review the [Before You Begin](/Getting%20Started/Before-You-Begin) page for details on these requirements before using the IQM API. 

Alternatively, see the [Authentication Quickstart Guide](/Quickstart%20Guides/Authentication-Quickstart-Guide) to sign up, log in, and obtain an authentication token. Then, see the Quickstart Guide for [Creating a New Campaign](/Quickstart%20Guides/Upload-Creative-and-Create-a-Campaign-API-Quickstart-Guide). 

Once these steps are completed see the other [Quickstart Guides](/Quickstart%20Guides/) and the [Guidelines](/Guidelines/) pages for a comprehensive overview of the IQM platform's API. 

## Authentication

The IQM API uses [bearer authentication<ExternalLink />](https://swagger.io/docs/specification/v3_0/authentication/bearer-authentication/) tokens to authenticate as well as an **Organization Workspace ID** (<var>owId</var>). Authentication is obtained on sign up and log in. 

Refer to the [Sign Up and Authenticate](/docs/Quickstart%20Guides/Authentication-Quickstart-Guide.mdx) Quickstart Guide for more information.
