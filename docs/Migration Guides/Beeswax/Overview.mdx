# Beeswax Migration Guide

## Overview

This guide provides you with tools to assist migrating common ad-tech workflows from Beeswax to the IQM platform: platform terminology, entity mapping, and endpoint-specific API protocol comparisons. These workflows use the unique REST API protocols of each platform to create and manage Campaigns and Insertion Orders, optimize budgets and audience-targeting parameters, apply advanced Conversion settings, and more. 

Refer to the Entities Comparison table for naming conventions and their descriptions, and to the migration guide's subsequent pages to compare detailed endpoint-specific protocols. 

## Entities Comparison 

Both IQM and Beeswax use similar organizational frameworks for their advertising management. While each platform has different naming conventions, their hierarchical structure is similar and involves some of the same relationships.

This table compares each platform's terminology and entity relationships. The descriptions use IQM's terminology. For full naming and hierarchy details, refer to [IQM Platform Overview](/Getting%20Started/Platform-overview) and [Accounts, Users, Roles, Permissions<ExternalLink />](https://api-docs.freewheel.tv/beeswax/v2.0/docs/accounts-users-roles-permissions).
