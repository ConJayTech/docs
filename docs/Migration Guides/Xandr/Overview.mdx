# Xandr Migration Guide

## Overview

Like IQM, Xandr is a DSP platform where advertisers can run advertising campaigns and buy inventory from ad exchanges in one user interface.  

Because both IQM and Xandr offer many of the same services, it is possible to migrate data from one service to the other. This is particularly the case with each of the service's API protocols. 

Some of the services the two platforms have in common are: creating and managing Campaigns and Insertion Orders, budget and audience targeting optimization, and advanced conversion settings. Each platform has a unique REST API interface to interact with and customize these parameters. 

This guide will cover and compare the platforms so users can migrate their data from Xandr to IQM's platform. This page will compare the major entities, how they are referred to and what they do. Subsequent pages will compare detailed endpoint-specific API protocols. 

## Entities Comparison 

Both IQM and Xandr use similar organizational frameworks for their advertising management. While each platform has different naming conventions, their hierarchical structure is similar and involves some of the same relationships.

For a more detailed summary of IQM's structure, see the [IQM Platform Overview](/docs/Getting%20Started/Platform-overview) page. 

For Xandr's structure see the [Network Relationship Diagram<ExternalLink />](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/xandr/digital-platform-api/network-relationship-diagram) page.

The table offers a brief comparison of advertising entities used by each platform.
