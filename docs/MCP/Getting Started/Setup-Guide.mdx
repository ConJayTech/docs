# Setup Guide

## Overview 

IQM MCP is a powerful interface that allows AI models to access information and functionality of IQM's various apps. Use this set up guide to get up and running with IQM MCP. 

## Before You Begin

Before you can use the IQM MCP, you will need access to use IQM's API service. See the [Getting Started](/Getting%20Started/Before-You-Begin) guide and [Authentication Quickstart Guide](/Quickstart%20Guides/Authentication-Quickstart-Guide) for more information. 

## Setup Guide

To use IQM MCP you will need the following tools:

* UV 
* mcp-proxy 
* VS Code 
* GitHub Copilot
* [Claude Desktop](https://claude.ai/download)

### Tools Installation

Follow these steps and run the following commands to install the necessary tools to configure the MCP servers:

##### 1. Install UV

```bash 
brew install uv
```

##### 2. Install MCP Proxy:

```bash 
uv tool install mcp-proxy
```

##### 3. Locate mcp-proxy Path

Once these tools are installed, locate the exact path of mcp-proxy:

```bash
which mcp-proxy
```

##### 4. Configure MCP Server


Then you can open **Claude Desktop → Settings → Developer → Edit Config**

This will open a JSON config file, to which you can add the MCP servers:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "iqm-mcp-server": {
      "command": "/Users/<your-username>/.local/bin/mcp-proxy",
      // The above command value is your mcp-proxy path where <your-username> is your actual system name
      "args": ["<http://maas-dashboard.data.iqm/<MCP_SERVER_1>/mcp>"]
    }
    "iqm-mcp-server": {
      "command": "/Users/<your-username>/.local/bin/mcp-proxy",
      "args": ["<http://maas-dashboard.data.iqm/<MCP_SERVER_1>/mcp>"]
      // <MCP_SERVER_1> is a placeholder for actual MCP servers
    }
  }
}
```
